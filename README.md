## Simplifying Data Fetching in React with Custom Hooks and useEffect.

When building a modern web application, it's common to fetch data from an external API to render dynamic content in the user interface. React provides the useEffect hook as a way to manage side effects, such as fetching data, in functional components. By using useEffect, you can declaratively specify when and how to fetch data, and update the component's state based on the response. In combination with the fetch API, you can create powerful and flexible data fetching logic that works seamlessly with React's state management system. However, writing this logic inline in the component can result in code that's difficult to read, test, and maintain. To address this issue, you can extract the useEffect block as a custom hook that encapsulates the data fetching logic and can be reused across multiple components. This approach improves code organization, separation of concerns, and reusability, and makes it easier to reason about the data fetching behavior of your application.
